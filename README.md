# Patient Data Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a web-based dashboard developed using **Django** and **JavaScript** to visualize patient data. The dashboard provides key insights, metrics, and trends regarding patient visits, lab results, and other medical data. It includes interactive data visualizations and filtering capabilities to help users explore patient information efficiently.

## Features

### 1. User Interface
- **Key Metrics Display**:
  - Average lab results
  - Percentage of patients with adverse outcomes
  - Number of visits by diagnosis
- **Filter Options**:
  - By diagnosis
  - By gender
  - By visit type
- **Dynamic Line Chart**:
  - Visualizes trends in lab results over time using **Chart.js**
- **Interactive Table**:
  - Displays individual patient records with options to **search**, **sort**, and **paginate**

### 2. Backend
- **Django Application**: Loads patient data from an SQL database.
- **API Endpoints**: Django REST Framework (DRF) APIs serve filtered data to the frontend.
- **Unit Tests**: Verifies filtering logic and data aggregation.

### 3. Frontend
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Line charts built with **Chart.js**.
- **JavaScript for Interactivity**: Data is dynamically updated based on user input.
- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is fully responsive across devices.

### Bonus Features (Optional)
- **CSV Export**: Allows users to export filtered patient data as a CSV file.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/patient-dashboard.git
   cd patient-dashboard
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file** for environment variables in the project root:

   ```bash
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   DEBUG=True  # Set to False in production
   DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost  # Adjust for production
   ```

3. **Run the project with Docker**:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

4. **Run migrations**:

   After the containers are running, apply database migrations:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Collect static files** (for production):

   ```bash
   docker compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

6. **Access the application**:

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost` to view the dashboard.

## API Endpoints

- **`/api/patients/`**: Fetches a list of patient records with optional filters.
- **`/api/lab-results/`**: Retrieves lab results data for the dynamic chart.

---

## Features Explanation

### API Data Filtering
The API provides filtered data based on user selections such as diagnosis, gender, and visit type. These filters allow the dashboard to narrow down the data displayed, updating the charts and patient records dynamically.

### Charts and Data Visualization
The dashboard features dynamic line charts built with **Chart.js** that visualize trends in patient lab results over time. The data in these charts is updated based on the selected filters.

### Table of Patient Records
An interactive table is included to display individual patient records. Users can:
- Search for specific patients.
- Sort the table based on columns (e.g., name, diagnosis, visit type).
- Paginate through the list of records for better usability.

---

## Unit Testing

To ensure the accuracy of the filtering logic and data aggregation, unit tests are included. You can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py test
```

This will run tests to verify the backend functionality.

## Deployment

### Docker Compose Setup

The project is configured to run using Docker Compose. Here's a breakdown of the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: gunicorn health_dashboard.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    expose:
      - "8000"
    environment:
      - DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost
      - DEBUG=1

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    depends_on:
      - web
```

- **`web` service**: This is your Django application served via Gunicorn, a production-ready WSGI server. It exposes port 8000.
- **`nginx` service**: Acts as a reverse proxy for the Django application, forwarding requests from port 80 to port 8000 inside the container.

### Production Deployment
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that `DEBUG=False` and `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` is set to the production domain.
- **HTTPS**: For production environments, it is recommended to configure SSL/TLS certificates for secure connections. This can be achieved with Let's Encrypt or other SSL providers.

### Scaling
In production, you can scale your services by increasing the number of Gunicorn workers or by using Docker Compose’s `scale` feature:

```bash
docker compose up --scale web=3
```

This will run 3 instances of the Django application to handle more requests.

## CSV Export (Bonus Feature)

Users can export the filtered patient data as a CSV file. The filtered data is dynamically generated based on the selected filters, and users can click an "Export" button to download the CSV file.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Real-Time Data**: Integrate WebSockets to update the dashboard with live patient data.
- **Improved Filtering**: Add more granular filters, such as patient location or specific treatment types.
- **Security Enhancements**: Add two-factor authentication (2FA) for increased security.

### Changes Made:
- **Removed Authentication Feature**: All mentions of authentication were removed from the original README.
- **Removed Risk Score Feature**: All mentions of the risk score calculation were removed.

This version should now accurately reflect the features of your project without referencing any features you haven’t implemented.
